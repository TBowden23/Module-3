      Our #1 mission is to lead a revolution against the very machines you're probably viewing this site on right now. We know that life is meant to be lived, not spent staring at a screen sitting on your tail. We wish to facilitate the growth of a worldwide community built around a more balanced way of life. 
      <br><br>Our founder spent the first two decades of his life in a small city never getting to experience the peace and joy of the outside world until he joined the Army Reserves and his eyes were opened to the positive grounding experience of hoofing it in the suck as so many in the service refer to it. Now with years of Camping and Hiking experience in multiple different states and climates under his belt Tremar realized how spending a short time out in the suck really made a difference in his mental clarity and attitude. He made it a goal to share this completely free reset with as many people as possible. 
      <br><br>NorthStarr Camping and Surplus is his attempt at doing this. We arenâ€™t just an ecommerce site we are a Lifestyle built to aid you in your journey to disconnect. We are aiming to connect you to others looking to regain what technology has taken from Humanity, everyone from the beginner to the hardened veteran will find something of use within our pages.
